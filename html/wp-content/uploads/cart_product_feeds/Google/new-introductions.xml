        <description><![CDATA[Can be used as a patio plant where some shade is provided, or in dish gardens. In habitat, many Echeverias grow on rocky out croppings at higher altitudes. In this habitat, the water drains quickly away from the roots of the plant, never allowing the plant to remain waterlogged. For this reason, it is essential in cultivation to use a very porous soil, which will allow quick drainage. Bright light is required to prevent etiolation ("stretching") of Echeverias. (Etiolation occurs when a moderately fast growing plant such as an Echeveria, is grown in dim light or is over-fertilized, causing overly lush growth that contributes to weak, pallid plants). Water thoroughly when soil is dry to the touch. Protect from frost to prevent scarring of the leaves. This is an Altman Plants original hybrid created by Renee O' Connell.]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[<em>echeveria</em> 'crimson Tide'<br />uspp 21496]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[Can be used as a striking patio plant, and has been proven to be landscape tolerant at our inland Escondido nursery. Will flower in pots, but in the ground will put on a massive show of tall spikes of flowers loved by hummingbirds. In habitat, many Echeverias grow on rocky outcroppings at higher altitudes. In this habitat, the water drains quickly away from the roots of the plant, never allowing the plant to remain waterlogged. For this reason, it is essential in cultivation to use a very porous soil, which will allow quick drainage. Bright light is required to prevent etiolation ("stretching") of Echeverias.
